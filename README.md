> Go green, not mad

Sorter is a simple web application that uses vue js, firebase and node js along IBM Watson Visual Recognition to create an easy to use waste-sortering tool. 

It divides waste into three categories: 
- Compost
- Landfill
- Recycle

### Application flow

1. The user uploads an image
2. The image is stored in Firebase Storage
3. The link from Firebase image goes to backend and is analized, returning the results.
4. The image is deleted.
